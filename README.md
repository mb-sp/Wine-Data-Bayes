# Wine-Data-Bayes
Done in RStudio.
Group Project for Bayesian Analysis that was studying Wine Data and its distributions on the ratings of many different data points (different variations of wine).
Tested relationship between price and rating of wines, confirmed normality and distribution consistency with MCMC chains and autocorrelation plots, and uesd LOO cross-validation to support predictability.
I was in charge of the MCMC chains, density plot, and autocorrelation plots.
